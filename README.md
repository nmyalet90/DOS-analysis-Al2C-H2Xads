# Density of States analysis on the interaction of H‚ÇÇX molecules with Al‚ÇÇC nanosheet (X = O, S, Se, Te)

This project performs a comparative analysis of the **Density of States (DOS)** for the interaction of H‚ÇÇX molecules with the Al‚ÇÇC nanosheet (X = O, S, Se, Te).
The datasets (DOSCAR files) were obtained after DFT calculations with the VASP code (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package).
The studied systems are: a clean Al‚ÇÇC nanosheet and the Al‚ÇÇC nanosheet interacting with the molecules H‚ÇÇO, H‚ÇÇS, H‚ÇÇSe and H‚ÇÇTe.
DOS of molecular adsorptions (Al‚ÇÇC + H‚ÇÇX) and partial dissociation (Al‚ÇÇC + HX-H) are calculated. 
The goal is to investigate how the adsorption affect the electronic properties of the systems, particularly the band gap of Al‚ÇÇC.

## üî¨ Systems Analyzed

The following systems were analyzed:

- Clean Al‚ÇÇC
- Al‚ÇÇC + H‚ÇÇO
- Al‚ÇÇC + HO-H
- Al‚ÇÇC + H‚ÇÇS
- Al‚ÇÇC + HS-H
- Al‚ÇÇC + H‚ÇÇSe
- Al‚ÇÇC + HSe-H 
- Al‚ÇÇC + H‚ÇÇTe
- Al‚ÇÇC + HTe-H 

## üìÅ Files

- `DOS-Al2C-H2X.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook for plotting and comparing DOS.
- `DOSCAR_*`: VASP output files used to extract total DOS information for each system.

## üìä Methodology
- DOSCAR files were generated with VASP code after DFT calculations. HSE06 hybrid functional was used. 
- DOS data was extracted from `DOSCAR` files using a custom `read_doscar()` function.
- Band gap values were computed for each system.
- Subplots (2√ó2) visualize the DOS comparison between:
  - Clean Al‚ÇÇC 
  - Molecular adsorptions (Al‚ÇÇC + H‚ÇÇX)
  - Partial dissociation (Al‚ÇÇC + HX-H)
- The band gap for each configuration is included in the legend of each plot.
- The X-axis is limited to -1 eV to 2 eV to focus on the region around the Fermi level.

## üñºÔ∏è DOS Comparison Plot

Each subplot includes:
- Solid line: DOS of H‚ÇÇX adsorbed on Al‚ÇÇC
- Dashed line: DOS of dissociated HX-H configuration on Al‚ÇÇC 
- Black line: DOS of clean Al‚ÇÇC
- The band gap values for each configuration are shown in the legend

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python ‚â• 3.8
- matplotlib

## üß† Conclusions

The calculated energy gap for the pristine Al‚ÇÇC nanosheet is 1.078‚ÄâeV. However, it increases significantly to 1.371, 1.338, 1.379 and 1.416‚ÄâeV for molecular adsorption (H‚ÇÇO, H‚ÇÇS, H‚ÇÇSe and H‚ÇÇTe, respectively) and to 1.209, 1.363, 1.370 and 1.388‚ÄâeV for partial dissociative adsorption.
The increase in the energy gap means the electrical conductivity decreases. Because the conductivity can be measure by sensors, these results could be considered as an indication that the Al‚ÇÇC nanosheet has a potential use as a sensor for these molecules in molecular or dissociated state. However, experiments and experimental results are needed in order to reach definitive conclusions.
